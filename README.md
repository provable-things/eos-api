Thanks to this __EOS API__, enriching your smart-contracts with external data using __Oraclize__ is very easy!

In C++ it is as simple as including the __`eos_api.hpp`__ library that you'll find in this repository.

This will provide your contract with functions like __`oraclize_query(...)`__, which make it trivial for you to leverage our oracle technology straight away.

Simply import __Oraclize__ into your contract like so:

```c++

#include "oraclize/eos_api.hpp"

```

To learn more about the Oraclize technology, please refer to our __[documentation here](https://docs.oraclize.it)__.

### CDT Compatiiblity

The `eos_api.hpp` library in this repo is compatible with the EOSIO CDT 1.4.0.

For the Oraclize EOS API compatible with the CDT 1.6.1, just go to the branch [eosio.cdt-1.6.1](https://github.com/oraclize/eos-api/tree/eosio.cdt-1.6.1).

### :computer: See It In Action!

For working examples of how to integrate the __Oraclize__ EOS API into your own smart-contracts, head on over to the __[Oraclize EOS Examples](https://github.com/oraclize/eos-examples)__ repository. Here you'll find various examples that use __Oraclize__ to feed smart-contracts with data from a variety of external sources.
